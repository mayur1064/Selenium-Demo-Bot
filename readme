		a. Used to store non-sensitive configuration data in the form of key-value pairs. Allows you to separate application configuration from your container image
		b. Can be mounted as a file into a Deployment/Pod 

		a. It is a custom Kubernetes resource used with the CSI Secrets Store Driver to mount secrets, keys, or certificates from external secret stores like Azure Key Vault directly into pods as volume
		b. Specifies what Identity to use to connect to Azure Key Vault ( Pod Identity, workload Identity)
		c. Tells the CSI driver what secrets to fetch and how to mount them into pods
		d. CSI  (Container Storage Interface) Driver - 
			i. Kubernetes Plugin to connect to storage systems, like cloud volumes, file shares, or even secrets
			ii. In AKS, CSI drivers are used to integrate Kubernetes with ( Azure files, Azure Disks , Azure Key Vault)
		e. This SecretProviderClass can then be used in multiple Deployments to mount secrets from key Vault.
	9. ServiceAccount
		a. It is used to provide an identity for processes that run in a Pod to interact with the Kubernetes API
		b. Used by pods to authenticate to the Kubernetes API server
		c. Automatically mounted into pods as a token so the pod can make API calls if needed
		d. Every namespace has a default ServiceAccount named default, used if no other SA provided for Pod
		e. In AKS, Service Accounts can be linked to Azure AD Workload Identity or Managed Identities to securely access Azure services like Key Vault, Blob Storage, etc., without secrets
			i. Create a ServiceAccount. Annotate it with a clientId of an Azure-managed identity
			ii. Grant that managed identity permissions to Azure resources
