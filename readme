In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), a namespace is a logical grouping or partitioning mechanism used to organize and isolate resources within a 
Kubernetes cluster. Namespaces allow you to divide cluster resources among multiple users, teams, or applications, 
providing a way to manage and scope objects like pods, services, deployments, and other Kubernetes resources.


Service provides stable networking identity to the Pods consistent IP and DNS name, even if the underlying Pods change. It helps with Load Balancing and Service DIscovery 

Pod is the smallest and most basic deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster and can contain one or more containers that share the same network, storage, and lifecycle.

A Deployment is a higher-level Kubernetes resource used to manage and maintain a set of Pods , Rolling Updates & Rollbacks , and defines replicas , Scaling conditions , Self-Healing. 


 VirtualService is a resource provided by Istio, a service mesh for Kubernetes, that controls how requests are routed within the cluster.
 It enables traffic management, routing rules, authorization, and retries for microservices
 
ServiceAccount is a special type of account used by Pods to authenticate with the Kubernetes API. It provides a way to control permissions and access for applications running inside Pods.
Each Pod has its Default serviceAccount , and we can create custom Service Account as well , and assign roles to it 

SecretProviderClass is a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) provided by the Azure Key Vault. It allows you to fetch secrets securely from Azure Key Vault and mount them as files inside a Pod.
