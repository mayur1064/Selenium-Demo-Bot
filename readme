	11. HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA)
		a. Automatically scales the number of pods in a deployment, replica set, or stateful set based on observed CPU utilization or custom metrics
	12. VerticalPodAutoscaler (VPA)
		a. Automatically adjusts the CPU and memory requests/limits of containers in pods based on observed usage over time
		b. It will adjust CPU/memory requests automatically by restarting pods if needed
VPA and HPA can conflict if used on same Pod , if operating on same metric (CPU usage). VPA can request more CPU and then HPA will scale by noticing high CPU usage.
