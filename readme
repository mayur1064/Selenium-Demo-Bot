Managed Identities are a feature of Azure Active Directory (AAD) that let your applications securely access Azure resources (like Key Vault, Storage Accounts, Databases, etc.) without needing to manage secrets, keys, or credentials

There are two types of Managed Identities:

System-Assigned Managed Identity (SAMI)

Tied to a specific Azure resource (VM, App Service, AKS, etc.).

Created automatically by Azure.

Lifecycle is tied to the resource (deleted when the resource is deleted).

User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI)

A standalone Azure resource that you create.

Can be assigned to one or multiple Azure resources.

Lifecycle is independent of any resource (it wonâ€™t be deleted if a VM/App Service is deleted).

Useful if you want to reuse the same identity across multiple services or rotate resources without losing identity access.
